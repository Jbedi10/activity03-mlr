Day 1 - Fitting a MLR Model
================

In this repository/directory you should see two items:

- `README.md` - this document.
- `activity03.Rmd` - the file you will complete in RStudio for this
  week.

## Task 1: Open the RMarkdown document

Read these directions first, then work through them.

- In the **Files** pane of RStudio, locate and click on the
  `activity03.Rmd` file to open it.

![check-in](../README-img/noun-magnifying-glass.png) **Check in**

Take a few moments to review your `activity02.Rmd` file (the one from
last week) and take note of: - What do you like about its organization
and what would you do differently? - What markdown skills do you
practice/expand in this week’s activity?
Since STA 518 I have used Rmarkdown files for everything I do in R - the usability is unmatched and the formatting capabilities 
makes working with these type of files extremely easy.

Consider my `README` documents and how they are organized. I do not
think these are the “best” way, but they do follow typical standards
(headers, sections, code formatted text, labeled R chunks, etc.)

As you work through this activity, be descriptive in your response to
questions and even leave comments in your code to help you understand
what you are doing. These are your notes to yourself. How can you make
it easier for *future* your to remember what *current* you is
thinking/doing?

## What is next?

We will continue exploring MLR models and assess their fit using
`{tidymodels}`.
